# QRList

This application can be a replacement for traditional paper entry logs only in situations where QR codes or barcodes are assigned to each person.

I will copy and modify these codes into a new project.
Because I want these codes to work on many other platforms as well.

The new project will be named 'EntryLogManager', and the project will also be registered in the repository of my account.

All of these codes are open source and those who wish to use them are free to take and modify them.
