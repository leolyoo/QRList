# QRList

This application can replace traditional paper entry logs only in situations where each person has their own QR code or barcode.

I will copy and modify these codes into a new project.
Because I want these codes to work on many other platforms as well.

The new project will be named 'EntryLogManager', and the project will also be registered in the repository of my account.

All of these codes are open source, and those who wish to use them are free to take and modify them.
